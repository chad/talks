"Avant Garde"
Vanguard - "a position at the forefront of new developments or ideas"

Experiments are liberating
 - it's OK to fail at proving the thing you're trying to prove because you have learned.
 - Learning is the goal
  -

What's the difference between an experiment and a failure?

Misuse of the term is dangerous
  - Excuse for being lazy
  - Excuse for doing things "my way"

Good types of experimentation in our field:
  - TDD
  - Software architecture
  - Languages
  - Product design/development (AB tests as an example)
  - Agile development (show Dave's thing)

Characteristics of a good experiment
  - small?
  - measurable
  - goal

Cost vs benefit?

Agility
